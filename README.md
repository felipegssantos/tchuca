# Tchuca

Tchuca is a very simple board game that can played by a single individual. The rules are simple enough to allow for simple implementations in many programming languages.

I particularly enjoy it because it is simple to implement in object-oriented languages and therefore helps me learn basic syntax of new languages. Moreover, it is also a very good example for quickly teaching some of the basics of OOP to newcomers.
